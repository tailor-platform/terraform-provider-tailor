# tailor_idp (Resource)

The idp resource represents an Identity Provider (IdP) service in Tailor.

```terraform
resource "tailor_idp" "starwars_idp" {

  namespace    = "starwars-idp"

  authorization = {
    insecure = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `authorization` (Attributes) The authorization configuration for the IdP service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--authorization))
- `namespace` (String) The namespace name for this IdP service.
- `workspace_id` (String) The ID of the workspace that the IdP service belongs to.

### Optional

- `labels` (Map of String) Labels for this IdP service.
- `lang` (String) Language subtag (IETF BCP 47). Allowed values: `en`, `ja`. Default: `en`.
- `user_auth_policy` (Attributes) The user authentication policy configuration for the IdP service. This is optional and can be omitted if the default authentication behavior is desired. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--user_auth_policy))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the resource.
- `provider_url` (String) The provider URL for the IdP service (computed).

### Nested Schema for `authorization`

Optional:

- `expr` (String) The CEL expression to evaluate for authorization. This option is mutually exclusive with insecure and logged_in_user.
- `insecure` (Boolean, Deprecated) **Deprecated.** Whether to allow insecure authorization for the IdP service. This option is mutually exclusive with expr and logged_in_user. Note that all IdP dataplane operations now implicitly require authentication, so this option no longer bypasses authentication. Use 'expr' with a custom CEL expression instead.
- `logged_in_user` (Boolean, Deprecated) **Deprecated.** Whether to allow access only to logged-in users. This option is mutually exclusive with insecure. All IdP dataplane operations now implicitly require authentication. Use 'expr' with a custom CEL expression instead, or omit the authorization block.

### Nested Schema for `user_auth_policy`

Optional:

- `allow_self_password_reset` (Boolean) Allow users to reset their own password via a "Forgot Password?" link on the sign-in screen.
- `password_max_length` (Number) Maximum password length. Valid range is 6-4096. When 0 (unset), uses default value 4096.
- `password_min_length` (Number) Minimum password length. Valid range is 6-30. When 0 (unset), uses default value 6.
- `password_require_lowercase` (Boolean) Whether to require at least one lowercase letter in the password. Defaults to false.
- `password_require_non_alphanumeric` (Boolean) Whether to require at least one non-alphanumeric character (special character) in the password. Defaults to false.
- `password_require_numeric` (Boolean) Whether to require at least one numeric digit in the password. Defaults to false.
- `password_require_uppercase` (Boolean) Whether to require at least one uppercase letter in the password. Defaults to false.
- `use_non_email_identifier` (Boolean) Whether to allow non-email identifiers for user authentication. When set to true, users can authenticate using identifiers other than email addresses (such as usernames). When set to false or omitted, only email addresses are accepted as user identifiers. Defaults to false.
