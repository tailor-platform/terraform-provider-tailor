# tailor_application (Resource)

The application resource represents an application in Tailor. An application contains a set of subgraphs that are used to define the application's behavior. The application resource may also contains configuration for user authentication and CORS.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "tailor_application" "starwars" {
  workspace_id = tailor_workspace.starwars.id

  name = "star-wars"
  cors = [
    "http://localhost:3000", # Allow local development
  ]
  allowed_ip_addresses = [
    "0.0.0.0/0", # Allow all
  ]
  auth = {
    namespace       = tailor_auth.starwars_auth.namespace
    idp_config_name = tailor_auth_idp_config.oidc.name
  }
  subgraphs = [
    {
      type      = "tailordb"
      namespace = tailor_tailordb.galaxy.namespace
    },
    {
      type      = "stateflow"
      namespace = tailor_stateflow.construction.namespace
    },
    {
      type      = "pipeline"
      namespace = tailor_pipeline.starwars.namespace
    },
    {
      type      = "auth"
      namespace = tailor_auth.starwars_auth.namespace
    }
  ]
}
```
